## Introduction

In this project, we showcase how to set up a continuous deployment (CD) pipeline using Ansible and Jenkins. The pipeline automates the process of deploying applications to various environments, ensuring consistency and reducing the risk of human error.

## Features

- **Automated Deployment**: Use Jenkins to automate the deployment process.
- **Configuration Management**: Use Ansible to manage and configure the deployment environment.
- **Scalability**: Easily scale the deployment process to multiple servers.
- **Continuous Integration**: Integrate with Jenkins to achieve continuous integration and deployment.

## Architecture

The architecture of the continuous deployment pipeline consists of the following components:

1. **Jenkins**: Automates the build and deployment process.
2. **Ansible**: Manages and configures the deployment environment.
3. **Target Servers**: Servers where the application will be deployed.

Setup and Installation

To set up and run the continuous deployment pipeline, follow these steps:

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/Mamiololo01
Continuous-deployment-using-Ansible-and-Jenkins.git

cd Continuous-deployment-using-Ansible-and-Jenkins

Install Jenkins:

Follow the official Jenkins installation guide: Jenkins Installation

Start Jenkins and set up the initial configuration.

Install Ansible:

Follow the official Ansible installation guide: Ansible Installation

Configure Jenkins:

Install the necessary Jenkins plugins (e.g., Ansible plugin, Git plugin).

Create a new Jenkins job and configure the build steps to use Ansible for deployment.

Set up Ansible Inventory:

Define the target servers in the Ansible inventory file (inventory.ini):

INI
[webservers]
server1 ansible_host=192.168.1.1 ansible_user=deploy

server2 ansible_host=192.168.1.2 ansible_user=deploy

Create Ansible Playbook:

Create an Ansible playbook (deploy.yml) to define the deployment tasks:
YAML
- name: Deploy application
  hosts: webservers
  tasks:
    - name: Ensure application directory exists
      file:
        path: /var/www/myapp
        state: directory

    - name: Copy application files
      copy:
        src: /path/to/source
        dest: /var/www/myapp

Configure Jenkins Job:

In Jenkins, configure the job to execute the Ansible playbook as part of the build process.

Usage

To use the continuous deployment pipeline, follow these steps:

Trigger the Jenkins Job:

Manually trigger the Jenkins job or set up a webhook to trigger it automatically on code changes.

Monitor the Deployment:

Use the Jenkins interface to monitor the progress and status of the deployment.

Verify the Deployment:

Ensure that the application is deployed correctly on the target servers.
